# Product Documentation

Product-level docs describe the product's goals, architecture, and roadmap.

- `mission.md` - mission and guiding principles.
- `architecture.md` - architecture overview (system boundaries + key decisions).
- `roadmap.md` - roadmap and milestones.
- `tech-stack.md` - current stack and planned extensions.
- `standards/` - engineering standards (backend, testing, conventions; frontend standards apply only when a frontend exists).
