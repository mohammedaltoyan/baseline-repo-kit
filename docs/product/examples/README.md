# Examples (Template)

Use this folder for small, self-contained examples referenced by docs (schemas, workflows, scripts, configs).

Rules:
- Keep examples generic (no customer/org identifiers, no secrets, no private URLs).
- Prefer short examples that demonstrate patterns (row-driven config, SSOT, decision logs).
- Link to these examples from docs instead of duplicating content across multiple files.
