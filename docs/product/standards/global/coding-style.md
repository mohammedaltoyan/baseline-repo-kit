## Coding style best practices

* **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Establish and follow naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and files across the codebase
* **Automated Formatting**: Maintain consistent code style (indenting, line breaks, etc.)
* **Meaningful Names**: Choose descriptive names that reveal intent; avoid abbreviations and single-letter variables except in narrow contexts
* **Small, Focused Functions**: Keep functions small and focused on a single task for better readability and testability
* **Consistent Indentation**: Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs) and configure your editor/linter to enforce it
* **Remove Dead Code**: Delete unused code, commented-out blocks, and imports rather than leaving them as clutter
* **Backward compatibility only when required:** Unless specifically instructed otherwise, avoid extra logic solely for backward compatibility.
* **DRY Principle**: Avoid duplication by extracting common logic into reusable functions or modules
* **Complete \& Dynamic Scripts**: Ensure all scripts are simple, scalable, dynamic, with zero redundancy and no hard coding; once written, a script should be final, reusable, and not require rewriting.
* **Duplicate Prevention**: Before creating any new file or script, always check if it already exists to avoid duplication and maintain a clean, unified codebase.
