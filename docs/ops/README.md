# Operations Documentation Index

Operational docs live under `docs/ops/`.

Core folders:
- `plans/` - canonical planning system (plans, focus, index, archive).
- `runbooks/` - runbooks and policies (project-agnostic templates).
- `checklists/` - checklist templates.
- `testing/` - testing templates and evidence checklists.
- `audits/` - audit templates.
- `evidence/` - generated evidence buckets (per project; keep the baseline clean).

Rule of thumb: keep docs generic in the baseline kit, and record project-specific evidence under `docs/ops/evidence/` in the project repo (not in this baseline).
