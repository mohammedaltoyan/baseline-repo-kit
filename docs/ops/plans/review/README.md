# Plan Review Artifacts

This folder stores **generated** plan review artifacts created by plan tooling (for example: summaries, reviewer briefs, and reviewer outputs).

- Generated by: `npm run plans:summarize` (and related reviewer-gate tooling)
- Expected shape: `docs/ops/plans/review/<plan_id>/<round>/...`

Baseline-kit note:
- This repository should not ship with historical review artifacts from other projects.
- This baseline's installer excludes `docs/ops/plans/review/**`, so target repos start empty (except this README).
