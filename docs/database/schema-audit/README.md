# Schema Audit (Template)

This folder is reserved for generated schema inventory/audit outputs and lightweight notes.

Baseline-kit rule:
- Do not commit "live DB" exports from another project into this baseline kit.
- Generate audit outputs per project and store evidence where your team expects it (often in CI artifacts or a dedicated evidence folder).
