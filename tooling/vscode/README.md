# VS Code Workspace Settings

Editor-specific configuration lives alongside other tooling metadata so the repository root stays clean.

- `settings.json` tracks shared workspace preferences (hidden directories, etc.).
- Add additional VS Code configuration files here (snippets, launch configs) and document their purpose in this README.
