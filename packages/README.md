# Packages (Shared Libraries)

This folder contains shared libraries/config used by multiple apps.

Rules:
- Keep packages small and domain-focused.
- Prefer stable contracts (types/interfaces) over cross-app imports.
- Shared configuration should have a single source of truth (SSOT) and be consumed by apps.
