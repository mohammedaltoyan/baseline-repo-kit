# Frontend App (Template)

Place your frontend/UI code here.

Enterprise defaults:
- Accessibility and responsive design by default.
- Keep shared UI and logic in `packages/` (not copied into multiple apps).
- Avoid hard-coded environment assumptions; use configuration and runtime env injection patterns.
